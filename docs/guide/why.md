# Why Eventix?

Eventix was designed to solve common challenges in event-driven applications while providing a great developer experience. Here's why you might want to use it:

## Type Safety First
Built from the ground up with TypeScript, Eventix provides complete type inference and compile-time checks for your event handlers.

## Flexible Validation
Choose your preferred validation library:
- TypeBox for runtime type checking
- Zod for schema validation
- Or create your own validator

## Zero Dependencies
The core package has no external dependencies, keeping your application lightweight.

## Tree-Shakeable
Only import what you need - unused code will be eliminated during bundling.
